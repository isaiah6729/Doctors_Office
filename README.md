INTRODUCTION

For this task, you will use the Performance Assessment Lab Area accessed by the Performance Assessment Lab Area in the web link to access the virtual lab environment to complete this task. The preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for this assignment is IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition). This assessment also requires the following software: the latest long term support (LTS) version of JDK, JavaFX SDK, and Scene Builder which are also available the Performance Assessment Lab Area.

SCENARIO

You are to develop a GUI-based scheduling desktop application. The contract is with a global consulting organization that conducts business in multiple languages. The consulting organization has provided a MySQL database that the application must pull data from. The database is used for other systems, so its structure cannot be modified.

Please use the attachment “Locale Codes for Region and Language” to review division data. Your company also supplies a list of contacts, which are prepopulated in the Contacts table; however, administrative functions such as adding users are beyond the scope of the application and done by your company’s IT support staff. Your application should be organized logically using one or more design patterns and generously commented using Javadoc so your code can be read and maintained by other programmers.
